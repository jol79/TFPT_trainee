The user should be able to provide an email where to send the magic link. 
The idea of a magic link is to permit to sign in without a password and registration. 
After each login session, the counter of sessions in the User model must be incremented by 1

How does it work?
  1) Provide your email and submit a form

  2) Receive mail and redirect using that link
